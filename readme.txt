An easy way to protect uploads from direct access by setting a user login for your files.

== Protect Uploads - Description ==
Normally everyone can access your uploads in the WordPress uploads directory. If you upload e.g. confidential documents, you should protect them in order to share the protected documents only with specific people, e.g. customers.
Protect Your Uploads gives you an easy way to protect your uploads from direct access.
You can set a username and password for each protected file, which is needed to login to access your protected file.
The user interface to protect uploads in the admin dashboard is intuitive and easy to use since it is the native WordPress style.
Therefore you can protect your files in less than a minute.

Protect your files (e.g. protect ebooks, protect PDF, protect images) with a user login.
Create a user with username and password and protect your uploads. If someone wants to directly access your protected uploads, he needs to login to access the uploaded file.
Otherwise access to the protected upload will be denied. If access to the protected file is granted, the protected file will be served normally.

= Protect Uploads - Block Crawling Bots from Indexing Protected Uploads =
You can tell search engines and crawling bots not to index your protected uploads. The protected content won't appear in the search results.
